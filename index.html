  <h1>Boston Bluebike Analysis</h1>

  <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>

  <p>Understanding Bluebike usage in Boston is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of urban transportation systems and their role in supporting sustainable mobility. As a publicly accessible bike-sharing service, Bluebikes offer an affordable and eco-friendly commuting option that helps reduce traffic congestion and environmental impact. Analyzing how and when people use these bikes provides insights into urban movement patterns and infrastructure efficiency.</p>

  <p>Weather conditions are among the most influential factors affecting bike-sharing activity. Favorable conditions like clear skies and moderate temperatures tend to encourage more ridership, while rain, snow, and extreme heat or cold often discourage use. By tracking changes in ride volume, timing, and user type under varying weather scenarios, we can better understand how environmental factors impact transportation choices and daily commuting behaviors.</p>

  <p>Beyond weather, temporal and demographic patterns also play a significant role. Usage often peaks during commuting hours and varies between weekdays and weekends. Additionally, distinct differences exist between casual and member riders. Exploring these factors helps identify user needs and supports smarter planning for future bike availability and station placement.</p>

  <p>To learn more about Bluebike usage and its impact on urban mobility, you can visit the <a href="https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data" target="_blank">Bluebikes official website</a> for system data or explore research insights from organizations like the <a href="https://www.boston.gov/departments/transportation" target="_blank">Boston Transportation Department</a>.</p>

  <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>

  <p>Our analysis utilizes two types of datasets. The primary dataset (bluebike_data.csv) from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akemail/blue-bike-boston-ma-bike-sharing-dataset" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, combines Bluebike trip records with hourly information from January 2022 to May 2024.</p>

  <p>This dataset consists of approximately 20,000 records and 15 features. It includes detailed accounts of usage by casual and registered members, trip durations, total activity counts, and travel times, coupled with comprehensive meteorological data recording temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. Enhanced with temporal data regarding days of the week, weekends, and public holidays, along with general weather conditions. </p>

  <p>For spatial analysis, we integrated three additional sources as the second type of dataset: trip records for February 2025, a geojson file of Boston neighborhoods, and a station location list. These were joined by station name and mapped to neighborhood polygons to calculate ride counts per area, highlighting geographic distribution in Bluebike usage.</p>

  <p>Before analysis, we also performed data cleaning. We removed null values, converted timestamps, filtered outliers, and ensured each trip is matched with accurate weather data, enabling time-based and environmental analysis. In the following sections, we will demonstrate the distribution of blue bikes in Boston, the impact of weather conditions on ridership, and usage patterns across different user types.</p>


  <h2>Geographic Distribution: Ride Count by Neighborhood</h2>
  <div class="center">
    <iframe src="map.html" width="80%" height="520" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
  <p>This choropleth map visualizes the total Bluebike ride count aggregated by Boston neighborhoods. Darker shades represent higher ridership, indicating areas with greater bike demand. According to the visualization, central neighborhoods such as Fenway, Back Bay, and Allston exhibit significantly higher usage compared to peripheral areas like Jamaica Plain or East Boston. These high-demand zones likely correlate with population density, commercial activity, and proximity to major transit hubs, reflecting the role of urban infrastructure and commuter behavior in shaping bike-sharing patterns.</p>
  <p>Neighborhoods with prominent universities, business districts, and transit connections see more consistent ridership, suggesting that accessibility and mixed land use are key drivers of demand. This spatial overview provides a foundation for further analysis, allowing us to explore how temporal and environmental factors impact usage trends in these neighborhoods.</p>
  
  <div class="center heatmap-section">
    <img src="heatmap.png" alt="Correlation Heatmap" width="80%">
  </div>  
  <p>Moreover, we create a heatmap to determine the factors to be explored afterwards through correlations between variables. In this corrrelation plot, casual_riders_count, member_riders_count, casual_rider_duration, and member_rider_duration all show significant positive correlations with count, which would inspire us to understand the behavioral patterns of different bluebike user types with those variables by using a suitable visualization (barchart later). In addition, temperature shows a moderate positive correlation with total ride count (0.45), which also leds us to consider using scatter plots to further examine the effects of different weather conditions on the ridership. The correlations between rel_humidity, wspd, IsWeekend and the other variables are weak so that we would temporarily neglect the analysis of these factors.</p>

  <h2>Hourly Bluebike Usage Trends by Weather Conditions</h2>
  <div class="center">
    <iframe src="lineplot.html" width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
  <p>This line chart visualizes the average hourly Bluebike usage segmented by weather condition. Ridership patterns reveal two distinct peaks across most weather types: a morning peak around 8:00 a.m. and a larger evening peak between 5:00–6:00 p.m. These peaks align with typical commuting hours, suggesting strong demand during weekday transitions to and from work or school. Usage remains lower and more stable during late night to early morning hours (12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.), suggesting minimal non-essential travel during these periods.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, rain and snow conditions significantly suppress overall ride counts and flatten the daily trend, indicating a sharp decline in ridership during adverse weather. An interesting observation is that cloudy weather shows slightly higher ridership compared to clear days, with a particularly noticeable difference around 5:00 p.m., suggesting that riders may be more willing to bike on cloudy days.</p>
  
  <h2>Extended Analysis of Weather Impact on Ridership</h2>
  <div class="center">
    <iframe src="scatter.html" width="100%" height="520" frameborder="0"></iframe>
  </div>
  <p>Building on the insights from hourly usage trends, this scatter plot explores the impact of weather on ridership more deeply.</p>
  <p>Between approximately 5°C and 25°C, ridership becomes significantly more active, with fair and clear weather showing the highest density of points in this optimal temperature range. In contrast, the density of points in snowy weather is significantly lower above 10°C, and it's mainly concentrated in the -10°C to 5°C range. This contrast highlights that weather has a significant impact on ridership, both excessively hot and cold temperatures result in lower use of blue bikes, with clear and cloudy being the more preferred weather for riding blue bikes.</p>
  <p>Looking at each weather category individually reveals more accurate behavioral patterns. Fair and clear days produce the highest ride counts, especially as temperatures climb, reflecting that good weather strongly boosts usage as we suggested before. Interestingly, cloudy days not only follow a similar growth trend but even slightly outperform clear days in ride volume at times which also corresponds to our findings in the last line plot, hinting that overcast but dry conditions may make riders more comfortable or flexible in their travel times. Rainy days show a flatter pattern with capped ridership, while snow days exhibit both the lowest temperatures and the sparsest, lowest ride counts, clearly signaling strong avoidance of bike usage in such conditions.</p>
  
  <h2>Member vs Casual Riders by Day of Week</h2>
  <div class="bar-section">
    <div class="center">
      <iframe src="barchart.html" width="80%" height="520" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To further understand rider behavior beyond weather influences, this bar chart explores how usage patterns vary by rider type across different days of the week. While the previous scatter plot revealed how environmental conditions affect total ridership, this chart highlights the behavioral distinctions between casual users and members. It shows that members consistently generate higher ride counts during weekdays, likely due to commuting routines, whereas casual riders tend to take fewer but longer trips, especially over the weekend. This distinction suggests different usage purposes—members ride out of necessity, while casual users bike more for leisure.</p> 
  
  <h2>Summary and Future Work</h2>

  <p>This analysis demonstrates how weather and user type shape Bluebike usage across Boston. Spatial patterns show higher ridership in central neighborhoods with strong transit access. Hourly trends confirm clear commuting peaks, especially under fair or clear conditions, while rain and snow reduce and flatten usage. Temperature between 5°C and 25°C encourages the most activity, and cloudy days sometimes outperform clear ones. Members ride more on weekdays for commuting, while casual users take longer leisure rides on weekends. The correlation heatmap supports these findings, showing strong links between weather, ride volume, and user behavior.</p>

  <p>While our analysis is based on data from January 2022 through May 2024, which offers valuable insights into current usage patterns, it may not fully capture seasonal fluctuations or rapid changes in user behavior. For future work, adding seasonal trends, precipitation intensity, or real-time data could improve accuracy. Exploring bike availability and system operations would also help optimize service and better support riders in different conditions.</p>
