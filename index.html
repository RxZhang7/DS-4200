  <h1>Bluebike Usage and Weather Analysis</h1>

  <h2>Overall Introduction</h2>

    <p>Understanding Bluebike usage in Boston is crucial for evaluating
      the effectiveness of urban transportation and enhancing the overall
      mobility experience for residents and visitors. Bluebike systems offer
      an affordable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional commuting, 
      thereby playing a key role in reducing traffic congestion and 
      environmental impact. </p>

    <p>Weather conditions are one of the most significant factors 
      influencing Bluebike ridership. Clear and pleasant weather tends
      to encourage more people to use Bluebikes, while rain, snow, or 
      extreme temperatures often result in a notable decline in trips. 
      This project examines how varying weather scenarios—ranging from sunny
      and clear skies to overcast, rainy, and snowy conditions—affect daily 
      ridership patterns and user behavior.</p>

    <p>In addition to weather, other factors such as time of day, day of
      the week, and the differences between regular members and casual users
      further shape usage trends. By analyzing these elements, we aim to 
      provide insights that can help optimize bike availability, improve 
      service planning, and ultimately enhance the overall user experience.</p>

  <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>

    <p>Our analysis makes use of two primary datasets. The first is a 
    <code>Bluebikes usage dataset</code> from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akemail/blue-bike-boston-ma-bike-sharing-dataset" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>, 
    containing detailed ride information from January 2022 through May 2024. 
    This dataset consists of approximately 20,000 records and 15 features. 
    Key attributes include ride start time, end time, start station, end station, 
    ride duration, and membership status (e.g., member vs. casual).</p>

    <p>The second dataset provides <strong>weather data</strong> corresponding 
    to each ride. It includes temperature, wind speed, humidity, and a 
    categorical weather condition (e.g., clear, cloudy, rainy, snowy). By 
    merging these datasets on the ride date (and hour), we can directly observe 
    how environmental factors correlate with Bluebike usage. </p>

<p>
  Before analysis, we performed <strong>data cleaning</strong> steps such as:
  removing incomplete or invalid records, converting timestamps into a 
  uniform format, and filtering out extreme outliers in ride duration. 
  We also combined the ride data with weather information by matching the 
  date and hour, ensuring that each ride is paired with accurate weather 
  conditions.
</p>

<p>
  For spatial analysis, we relied on existing station coordinate data 
  and city boundary information from Boston’s official 
  <a href="https://data.boston.gov/" target="_blank">open data portal</a>. 
  This allows us to create maps visualizing ride density across different 
  neighborhoods and highlight potential geographic trends in Bluebike usage.
</p>

<p>
  By merging trip metrics with corresponding weather variables, our dataset 
  provides a comprehensive view of how environmental factors affect 
  ridership patterns. In the following sections, we present various 
  visualizations to demonstrate how temperature, precipitation, wind speed, 
  and other factors correlate with changes in ride volume and duration.

  <!-- Textual Explanation Section -->
  <div class="text">
    <p>
      This bar chart provides an at-a-glance look at Bluebikes ridership patterns 
      across different days of the week. The data highlights how weekday commutes 
      drive a large portion of total trips, whereas weekends often show fewer rides 
      but longer average durations. Factors such as local events, station proximity 
      to popular attractions, and weather conditions can further influence these 
      variations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The higher volume of weekday trips suggests that many riders rely on Bluebikes 
      for regular commuting, underscoring the system’s importance in everyday urban 
      travel. Meanwhile, weekend ridership may reflect more leisure-oriented usage, 
      with riders potentially exploring scenic routes or tourist hotspots. 
      Understanding these trends helps in planning station maintenance, rebalancing 
      bikes during peak hours, and enhancing user satisfaction overall.

  <h2>Interactive Line Chart: Hourly Usage Trends by Weather</h2>
  <iframe src="lineplot.html" width="900" height="520" style="border:none;"></iframe>

  <p>This interactive line chart displays how Bluebike ride counts vary 
  throughout the day under different weather conditions. During clear 
  and fair weather, we see pronounced spikes in the early morning and 
  late afternoon—typical commuter peaks—indicating that riders are more 
  inclined to travel by bike when the weather is pleasant. In contrast, 
  rainy and snowy conditions tend to flatten these peaks, suggesting 
  that adverse weather discourages potential riders and alters typical 
  commuting behaviors. By hovering or clicking on different lines, you 
  can compare how each weather category affects ride volume at various 
  times of the day.

    <h2>Interactive Scatter Plot: Temperature vs Ride Count</h2>
    <p>
      This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between temperature and 
      daily Bluebike ride volume, segmented by specific weather conditions. 
      A convenient radio button allows you to filter the data to focus on 
      conditions such as Clear, Fair, Rain, or Snow. Overall, warmer days 
      often see a noticeable uptick in ride count, particularly under Clear 
      or Fair skies. Conversely, very hot or cold extremes can dampen 
      ridership, indicating that moderate temperatures provide the most 
      comfortable conditions for biking.

      By selecting a specific day from the dropdown menu, you can explore how ride counts and durations 
      vary by user type.Our analysis shows that casual riders typically enjoy longer ride durations, 
      while members contribute to a higher overall volume during weekdays,likely reflecting their 
      reliance on Bluebikes for daily commuting.

  <h3>Summary and Additional Work</h3>

  <p>In this visualization analysis, we explored how weather conditions impact Bluebike usage across Boston.
    Our study examined various factors such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed, 
    and how they influence ride counts, ride duration, and the behavior of both regular members and casual users.
    The interactive visualizations provide insights into hourly trends, spatial distribution, and user preferences, 
    highlighting the significant role that weather plays in shaping urban mobility.
  </p>
  
  <p>While our analysis is based on data from January 2022 through May 2024, which offers valuable insights into 
    current usage patterns, it may not fully capture seasonal fluctuations or rapid changes in user behavior. 
    Future work could incorporate more granular time-series analysis, integrate additional weather variables 
    such as precipitation intensity, and examine the impact of special events or transit disruptions. 
    Such enhancements would further refine our understanding and help optimize Bluebike service management.
